This is Software Engineering Project Group 6!

This program's goal is to enhance users' browsing experience when searching for articles on Arxiv. This software
uses graph neural network to predict how similar articles may be to recommend very semantically similar ones, also
providing translation and summarisation, removing the need to endlessly read the vast amount of papers in order to
find a particular one!

Main file of this program is enhanced_arxiv_search.py, where the main loop is.
