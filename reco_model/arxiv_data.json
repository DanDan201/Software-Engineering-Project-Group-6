            "summary": "  It is proposed that gamma-ray bursts are created in the mergers of double\nneutron star binaries and black hole neutron star binaries at cosmological\ndistances. Bursts with complex profiles and relatively long durations are the\nresult of magnetic flares generated by the Parker instability in a post-merger\ndifferentially-rotating disk. Some bursts may also be produced through\nneutrino-antineutrino annihilation into electrons and positrons. In both cases,\nan optically thick fireball of size $\\sles\\ 100$ km is initially created, which\nexpands ultrarelativistically to large radii before radiating. Several previous\nobjections to the cosmological merger model are eliminated. It is predicted\nthat $\\gamma$-ray bursts will be accompanied by a burst of gravitational\nradiation from the spiraling-in binary which could be detected by LIGO.\n",

The extinction to a type\nII-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty\nintroduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than\n10\\%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution we derive distances to 10\nsupernovae: SN 1968L, SN 1969L, SN 1970G, SN 1973R, SN 1979C, SN 1980K, SN\n1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1990E, and SN 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide\nrange, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc, which is unique among the methods for establishing\nthe extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to SN 1970G in M101\nand SN 1987A in the LMC are in good agreement with distances determined from\nCepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +- 3 Mpc, is\nlarger than recent distances estimates made using surface brightness\nfluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher\nmethod. Using the distances determined from these type II supernovae we derive\na value of $H_0 = 60 \\pm 10$ km sec$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$.

A major difficulty with this idea is that\nestimates of reasonable seed field strengths tend to be quite low, on the order\nof $\\sim10^{-20}$ gauss. Here we examine the contribution due to the flux\nentrained in winds from protostars formed in the first dynamo e-folding time of\na galaxy's existence. Using a minimal estimate of a protostellar magnetic field\nwe find that if each protostar ejects a single current ring, sufficient to\nmaintain flux freezing in the wind, than the large scale average dipole field\nfrom all such current rings will be at least 5 orders of magnitude larger than\nprevious seed field estimates. Allowing for a reasonable amount of magnetic\nactivity in protostars during an extended period of mass loss increases this to\na dipole seed field of $\\sim10^{-12}$ gauss. For the purposes of producing a\nseed field it is irrelevant whether or not this initial injection of flux takes\nplace in a newly formed galactic disk, or in star forming proto-galactic\nclouds. The compression of this dipole field into a thin disk will lead to a\nlarge scale $B_r\\sim 10^{-10.5}$ gauss. Initially, field strengths on smaller\nscales will be larger, but nowhere near current levels.\n",

The ratio of\nintensities between the broad and narrow components of Hbeta increased\nmonotonically from 15 in 1985 to 40 in 1991. The peak of the broad components\nof Hbeta and Halpha were known to be strongly displaced to the red. We have\ndiscovered a correlation between the amplitude of the broad peak displacement\nand the luminosity of Hbeta, in the sense that the displacement is larger when\nthe line luminosity is higher. We suggest that the observations are not\ncompatible with either a binary Broad Line Region model or one involving\nballistic acceleration of the line emitting gas. Radiative acceleration of a\nsystem of outflowing clouds readily explains the correlation between line shift\nand luminosity as well as the peculiar line profiles. Furthermore, it seems\nthat most or all of the Balmer emission originates from the inward face of the\nclouds.

We\nestimate the attainable maximum energy in the hot spot region allowed by the\ncanonical physical conditions, which are found from radio-to-optical\nobservations (Meisenheimer et al. 1989, A&A). We calculate observable the\nproton flux and spectrum from this sources, using all knowledge about source\ndistibution (Peacock 1985, MNRAS) and particle transport in the microwave\nbackground (Berezinsky and Grigor'eva 1988, A&A).

            "summary": "  Aside from primordial gravitational instability of the cosmological fluid,\nvarious mechanisms have been proposed to generate large-scale structure at\nrelatively late times, including, e.g., ``late-time'' cosmological phase\ntransitions. In these scenarios, it is envisioned that the universe is nearly\nhomogeneous at the time of last scattering and that perturbations grow rapidly\nsometime after the primordial plasma recombines. On this basis, it was\nsuggested that large inhomogeneities could be generated while leaving\nrelatively little imprint on the cosmic microwave background (MBR) anisotropy.\nIn this paper, we calculate the minimal anisotropies possible in any\n``late-time'' scenario for structure formation, given the level of\ninhomogeneity observed at present. Since the growth of the inhomogeneity\ninvolves time-varying gravitational fields, these scenarios inevitably generate\nsignificant MBR anisotropy via the Sachs-Wolfe effect. Moreover, we show that\nthe large-angle MBR anisotropy produced by the rapid post-recombination growth\nof inhomogeneity is generally greater than that produced by the same\ninhomogeneity grown via gravitational instability. In ``realistic'' scenarios\none can decrease the anisotropy compared to models with primordial adiabatic\nfluctuations, but only on very small angular scales. The value of any\nparticular measure of the anisotropy can be made small in late-time models, but\nonly by making the time-dependence of the gravitational field sufficiently\n``pathological''.\n",

As the\nradio background, the wealth of data on source counts make possible reliable\nestimations of the contribution from extragalactic sources. At 178 MHz we\nobtain an antenna temperature of about 22 K, with the 60% of the flux\ncontributed by radiogalaxies and quasars and the remaining part from sub-mJy\nradio sources. At high frequencies the compact sources, generally QSOs,\ndominate. An intense far-IR/sub-mm background is predicted if a large fraction\nof the hard X-ray Background (XRB) comes from starburst galaxies but this might\nface problems with the upper limits on the far-IR isotropic flux. To clarify\nthe problem spectral measurements should be complemented with the analysis of\nsmall scale anisotropies. The flattening of the QSO counts at B=19.5 suggests\nthat their contribution to the optical/near-IR background is small in\ncomparison to that of galaxies. As for the XRB, a consisting picture obtains\nconsidering two AGN populations: a \"soft X-ray spectrum\" population and a \"hard\nX-ray spectrum\" one, mainly contributing to the soft and to the hard XRB\nrespectively. A third population of extremely absorbed or of reflection\ndominated AGN could either be the dominant contributor of the XRB above 3 keV.\n",

This fact, which is observed substantially in\nlow-luminosity spirals, indicates that galaxy interactions can stimulate the\nformation of bars, primarily in early-type, low-luminosity spirals. This is in\npartial, qualitative agreement with the most recent relevant N-body\nsimulations. On the other hand, no significant density segregation is observed\nbetween pure S-shaped (S(s)) spirals and spirals with inner rings (S(r)), which\nare often associated with bars. {\\it Subject headings:} galaxies: general ---\ngalaxies: structure --- galaxies: interactions --- galaxies: clustering\n",

Apart from a bright ring visible on early\nphotographs of the system, an even brighter inner ring of \\ion{H}{2} regions is\nfound within the nuclear bulge of the galaxy. A very faint ring-arc of\n\\ion{H}{2} regions is also seen associated with a third outer ring or shell. An\ninvestigation of the H$\\alpha$ fluxes in the rings reveals an increase in the\nemission where the ring surface density in the R-band light exceeds\n21.3$\\pm$0.2 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. If the R-band light is dominated by old stars\nin the underlying density wave, then the results suggest evidence for a Star\nFormation law which exhibits a threshold dependence on the strength of the\ndensity wave in the rings. Even if the R-band continuum in the ring is heavily\ncontaminated with red light from the underlying young stars then a smaller, but\nstill significant non-linear enhancement in the star formation rates (SFR) in\none segment of the second ring is required to explain the results. In either\ncase, strong trends in the SFR with azimuth around Ring~2 are in good agreement\nwith off-center collisional ring galaxy models.\n",

Physically important ingredients besides the\npresence of a strong shock are diffusion, drifts, convection, adiabatic\ncooling, the injection history, and the topology of the magnetic field, here\nassumed for simplicity to be homogeneous in the interstellar medium. The result\nis a spectrum, which for strong shocks in a gas with adiabatic index 5/3 yields\na spectrum of E^-2.42. Interstellar turbulence with a Kolmogorov spectrum then\nleads by leakage from the galactic disk to a spectrum which is E^-2.75, as\nobserved. We argue that the ratio of cosmic ray electrons to protons is\ndetermined by the amount of expansion which takes place from the cessation of\nelectron injection to the break-up of the shell by cooling instabilities.

Many smaller, rapid flares are\nsuperimposed on a general doubling of the intensity. During the five-day period\nwhen sampling was roughly continuous, the rapid flaring had an apparent\nquasi-periodic nature, with peaks repeating every ~0.7 days. The short- and\nlong-wavelength ultraviolet light curves are well correlated with each other,\nand with the optical light curve deduced from the Fine Error Sensor (FES) on\nIUE. The formal lag is zero but the cross-correlation if asymmetric in the\nsense that the shorter wavelength emission leads the longer. The ultraviolet\nspectral shape varies a small but significant amount. The correlation between\nspectral shape and intensity is complicated; an increase in intensity is\nassociated with spectral hardening, but lags behind the spectral change by ~1\nday. The sign of the correlation is consistent with the nonthermal acceleration\nprocesses expected in relativistic plasmas, so that the present results are\nconsistent with relativistic jet models, which can also account for\nquasi-periodic flaring.

The distance to the faintest\nbursts in the halo is either $\\sim130$ Kpc or $\\sim270$ Kpc.\n  Although a signature of a nearby-extragalactic distance scale in the data is\nvery suggestive, we argue that a comparison with specific models is necessary\nbefore regarding our findings as a conclusive evidence.

In particular, we follow the transition\nbetween the quasi-static, secular decay of the orbit at large separation and\nthe rapid dynamical evolution of configurations approaching contact.

We argue that the\ntheory should also describe polymers in an {\\sl isotropic} solvent. The dense\nphase is analyzed in a Bogoliubov-like approximation, which assumes a broken\nsymmetry in the phase of the boson order parameter. We find a stiffening of the\nlongitudinal fluctuations of the nematic field, calculate the density-density\ncorrelation function, and extend the analysis to the case of ferro- and\nelectrorheological fluids. The boson formalism is used to derive a simple\nhydrodynamic theory which is indistinguishable from the corresponding theory of\npolymer nematics in an isotropic solvent at long wavelengths. We also use\nhydrodynamics to discuss the physical meaning of the boson order parameter. A\nrenormalization group treatment in the dilute limit shows that logarithmic\ncorrections to polymer wandering, predicted by de Gennes, are unaffected by\ninterpolymer interactions. A continuously variable Flory exponent appears for\npolymers embedded in a {\\sl two}-dimensional nematic solvent. We include free\npolymer ends and hairpin configurations in the theory and show that hairpins\nare described by an Ising-like symmetry-breaking term in the boson field\ntheory.\n",

The velocity distribution across the channel is very nearly a quadratic\nfunction of the distance from the center of the channel and reveals velocity\nslip at the boundaries; the temperature distribution is only approximately a\nquartic function of this distance from the center to the channel. The density\ndistribution across the channel is non-uniform. We attribute this\nnon-uniformity to the relatively high Mach number, approximately 0.5, in the\nfluid flow. An equation for the density distribution based on simple\ncompressibility arguments is proposed; its predictions agree well with the\nsimulation results. Validity of the concept of local dynamic temperature and\nthe variation of the temperature along the channel are discussed.\n",

The calculations of the undoped\nsystems agree well with the known results. When the system (C_{60} or C_{70})\nis doped with one or two electrons (or holes), the additional charges\naccumulate almost along an equatorial line of the molecule. The dimerization\nbecomes weaker almost along the same line. Two energy levels intrude largely in\nthe gap. The intrusion is larger in C_{70} than in C_{60}. Therefore,\n``polarons'' are predicted in doped buckminster- fullerenes. We calculate\noptical absorption coefficient for C_{60} in order to look at how ``polarons''\nwill be observed.

            "summary": "  Vortex motion in type II superconductors is studied starting from a variant\nof the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, in which the order parameter\nrelaxation time is taken to be complex. Using a method due to Gor'kov and\nKopnin, we derive an equation of motion for a single vortex ($B\\ll H_{c2}$) in\nthe presence of an applied transport current. The imaginary part of the\nrelaxation time and the normal state Hall effect both break ``particle-hole\nsymmetry,'' and produce a component of the vortex velocity parallel to the\ntransport current, and consequently a Hall field due to the vortex motion.\nVarious models for the relaxation time are considered, allowing for a\ncomparison to some phenomenological models of vortex motion in superconductors,\nsuch as the Bardeen-Stephen and Nozi\\`eres-Vinen models, as well as to models\nof vortex motion in neutral superfluids. In addition, the transport energy,\nNernst effect, and thermopower are calculated for a single vortex. Vortex\nbending and fluctuations can also be included within this description,\nresulting in a Langevin equation description of the vortex motion. The Langevin\nequation is used to discuss the propagation of helicon waves and the\ndiffusional motion of a vortex line. The results are discussed in light of the\nrather puzzling sign change of the Hall effect which has been observed in the\nmixed state of the high temperature superconductors.\n",

Bosons are shown to prefer zero flux (i.e. diamagnetism), and the\ncorresponding ``happy fluxes'' for the fermions identified.

The Ga $3d$ electrons are treated as band states, and no shape\napproximation is made to the potential and charge density. The influence of $d$\nelectrons on the band structure, charge density, and bonding properties is\nanalyzed. It is found that due to the energy resonance of the Ga 3$d$ states\nwith nitrogen 2$s$ states, the cation $d$ bands are not inert, and features\nunusual for a III-V compound are found in the lower part of the valence band\nand in the valence charge density and density of states. To clarify the\ninfluence of the Ga $d$ states on the cohesive properties, additional full and\nfrozen--overlapped-core calculations were performed for GaN, cubic ZnS, GaAs,\nand Si. The results show, in addition to the known importance of non-linear\ncore-valence exchange-correlation corrections, that an explicit description of\nclosed-shell repulsion effects is necessary to obtain accurate results for GaN\nand similar systems. In summary, GaN appears to be somewhat exceptional among\nthe III-V compounds and reminiscent of II-VI materials, in that its band\nstructure and cohesive properties are sensitive to a proper treatment of the\ncation $d$ bands, as a result of the presence of the latter in the valence band\nrange.\n",

Formally,\nthese equations are much more general, involving as they do a more or less\narbitrary ``system,'' characterized by some time-dependent potential, which is\ncoupled via a nonlinear, time-dependent interaction to a ``bath'' of\noscillators with time-dependent frequencies. The analysis reveals that, even in\na Markov limit, which can often be justified, the time dependences and\nnonlinearities can induce new and potentially significant effects, such as\nsystematic and stochastic mass renormalizations and state-dependent ``memory''\nfunctions, aside from the standard ``friction'' of a heuristic Langevin\ndescription. One specific example is discussed in detail, namely the case of an\ninflaton field, characterized by a Landau-Ginsburg potential, that is coupled\nquadratically to a bath of scalar ``radiation.'' The principal conclusion\nderived from this example is that nonlinearities and time-dependent couplings\ndo {\\em not} preclude the possibility of deriving a fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem, and do {\\em not} change the form of the late-time steady state\nsolution for the system, but {\\em can} significantly shorten the time scale for\nthe approach towards the steady state.\n",

Explicit solutions for the\nphase space quantum distribution function are found for the cases of power law\nand exponential expansions. The expectation values of dynamical variables with\nrespect to these solutions are compared to the corresponding cutoff regularized\nfield theoretic results (we do not restrict ourselves only to $\\VEV{\\F^2}$).\nFair agreement is found provided the coarse-graining scale is kept within\ncertain limits. By focusing on the full phase space distribution function\nrather than a reduced distribution it is shown that the thermodynamic\ninterpretation of the stochastic formalism faces several difficulties (e.g.,\nthere is no fluctuation-dissipation theorem). The coarse-graining does not\nguarantee an automatic classical limit as quantum correlations turn out to be\ncrucial in order to get results consistent with standard quantum field theory.\nTherefore, the method does {\\em not} by itself constitute an explanation of the\nquantum to classical transition in the early Universe.

The constraint appears polynomial in part, whereas the non-polynomial\npart is a non-linear sigma model type in (1+1)-dimensions.

We begin with an\nanalysis of the nature and origin of irreversibility in well-known physical\nprocesses such as dispersion, diffusion, dissipation and mixing, and make the\ndistinction between processes whose irreversibility arises from the stipulation\nof special initial conditions, and those arising from the system's interaction\nwith a coarse-grained environment. We then study the irreversibility associated\nwith quantum fluctuations in cosmological processes like particle creation and\nthe `birth of the Universe'. We suggest that the backreaction effect of such\nquantum processes can be understood as the manifestation of a\nfluctuation-dissipation relation relating fluctuations of quantum fields to\ndissipations in the dynamics of spacetime. For the same reason it is shown that\ndissipation is bound to appear in the dynamics of minisuperspace cosmologies.\nThis provides a natural course for the emergence of a cosmological and\nthermodynamic arrow of time and suggests a meaningful definition of\ngravitational entropy.

From the $W+\\geq 3$ jet events, a\n\"signal sample\" with an improved ratio of $t \\bar{t}$ to QCD produced $W$\nevents is selected by requiring each jet to be emitted centrally in the event\ncenter of mass frame. This sample contains 14 events with unusually hard jet\nE$_T$ distributions not well described by expectations for jets from direct QCD\n$W$ production and other background processes. Using expected jet E$_T$\ndistributions, a relative likelihood is defined and used to determine if an\nevent is more consistent with the decay of $t \\bar{t}$ pairs, with M$_{top}$~=~\n170 GeV/c$^2$, than with direct QCD $W$ production, while only 1.7 such\ntop--like events are expected in the absence of $t \\bar{t}$. Good agreement in\nthe jet spectra is obtained if jet production from $t \\bar{t}$ pair decays is\nincluded. For those events kinematically more consistent with $t \\bar{t}$ we\nfind evidence for a $b$-quark content in their jets to the extent expected from\ntop decay, and larger than expected for background processes.

The x- and $\\gamma$-ray\nenergy spectra for an \\nuc{241}{Am} source have been measured with the\nphotodiode operated at 13 K.

The O(4)\nmodel on the other hand is shown to have two characteristically different\nbehaviours; one for large Yukawa couplings where the fermions get infinitely\nheavy and decouple in the continuum limit, and one for small Yukawa couplings\nwhere the fermions remain light. For very small Yukawa couplings the fermions\nshow the expected tree level perturbative behaviour and for larger values the\ninfluence of the fermions becomes substantial. After estimating the finite size\neffects at small Yukawa couplings we make relatively accurate measurements of\nthe scalar mass and wave function renormalization constants at the point\n$\\kappa=0.0$ and $y=0.85-0.95$. Even though this is not the largest value\npossible for the Yukawa coupling we are able to show that the bound of the\nHiggs mass will move up significantly, from around $600 GeV$ to around $900\nGeV$, by including fermions in the model.

It is demonstrated that the\nnew algorithm $lacks$ an exponentially fast increase of the tunneling time\nbetween metastable states as a function of the linear size $L$ of the system.\nInstead, the tunneling time diverges approximately proportional to $L^{2.65}$.\nThus the computational effort as counted per degree of freedom for generating\nan independent configuration in the unstable region of the model rises\nproportional to $V^{2.3}$, where $V$ is the volume of the system. On our\nlargest lattice we gain more than two orders of magnitude as compared to a\nstandard heat bath algorithm. As a first physical application we report a high\nprecision computation of the interfacial tension.\n",

We observed phase\ntransitions which are probably second order, and found that the dual\nimplementation more effectively couples the spins to the quantum gravity.\n",

A consistent continuum limit of the model exists only if the\nrenormalized scale constant $\\beta_R$ vanishes for some value of the bare scale\nconstant~$\\beta$. The geodesic action has a special form that allows direct\naccess to the small-$\\beta$ limit. In this limit half of the degrees of freedom\ncan be integrated out exactly. The remaining degrees of freedom are those of a\ncompact model having a $\\beta$-independent action which is noteworthy in being\nunbounded from below yet yielding integrable averages. Both the exact action\nand the $\\beta$-independent action are used to obtain $\\beta_R$ from Monte\nCarlo computations of field-field averages (2-point functions) and\ncurrent-current averages. Many consistency cross-checks are performed. It is\nfound that there is no value of $\\beta$ for which $\\beta_R$ vanishes. This\nmeans that as the lattice cutoff is removed the theory becomes that of a pair\nof massless free fields. Because these fields have neither the geometry nor the\nsymmetries of the original model we conclude that the $O(1,2)/O(2)\\times Z_2$\nmodel has no continuum limit.\n",

In a high statistics numerical\nsimulation using a Swendson-Wang algorithm, we study cubic lattices of\ndimension as large as $64^3$ and measure correlation functions on long lattices\nof dimension $20^2\\times 120$ and $30^2\\times 120$. These correlations are\ncontrolled by the spectrum of the transfer matrix. This spectrum is studied in\nthe vicinity of the phase transition. The analysis classifies the spectral\nlevels according to an underlying $S_3$ symmetry. Near the phase transition the\nspectrum agrees nicely with a simple four-component hamiltonian model. In the\ncontext of this model, we find that low temperature ordered-ordered interfaces\nnearly always involve a disordered phase intermediate. We present a new\nspectral method for determining the surface tension between phases.\n",

We have studied the crossover between the high and\nlow temperature regimes for three values of the hopping parameter, kappa=0.16,\n0.17, and 0.18. At each of these values of kappa we have carried out spectrum\ncalculations on 12^3x24 lattices for two values of the gauge coupling in the\nvicinity of the crossover in order to set an energy scale for our\nthermodynamics calculations and to determine the critical value of the gauge\ncoupling for which the pion and quark masses vanish. For kappa=0.17 and 0.18 we\nfind coexistence between the high and low temperature regimes over 1,000\nsimulation time units indicating either that the equilibration time is\nextremely long or that there is a possibility of a first order phase\ntransition. The pion mass is large at the crossover values of the gauge\ncoupling, but the crossover curve has moved closer to the critical curve along\nwhich the pion and quark masses vanish, than it was on lattices with four time\nslices. In addition, values of the dimensionless quantity T_c/m_rho are in\ncloser agreement with those for staggered quarks than was the case at N_t=4.

            "summary": "  We consider the question of vacuum alignment in the recently proposed\n\"composite technicolor\" (CTC) models. In order for these models to work, an\n\"ultrafermion\" condensate must align in a particular way, driven by the\ncompetition between ultrafermion masses and \"flavor\" gauge boson exchange. We\nshow that for ultrafermion masses large enough to explain the top quark mass,\norder-of-magnitude estimates are sufficient to establish that the required\nvacuum alignment cannot occur for perturbative values of the flavor gauge\ncouplings. If the top quark gets its mass from some other mechanism, a detailed\ncalculation is required. Using spectral function sum rules and a vector-meson\nsaturation approximation which is known to work well in QCD, we determine the\ncorrect vacuum for this case in a limit where the flavor gauge bosons are\nweakly coupled and the number of ultracolors $N$ is large. We again find that\nthe vacuum required by CTC models does not occur for perturbative values of the\nflavor gauge couplings. We conclude that there is no evidence that the vacuum\naligns as required in CTC models.\n",

This situation is similar to that of theories with\ncontinuous R-symmetries, for which Hall and Randall have suggested that gluino\nmasses could arise through mixings with an octet of chiral fields. We note that\nin hidden sector models, such mixing can only occur if the auxiliary D field of\na $U(1)$ gauge field has an expectation value. This in turn gives rise to a\ncatastrophically large Fayet-Iliopoulos term for ordinary hypercharge. To solve\nthis problem it is necessary to unify hypercharge at least partially in a\nnon-Abelian group. We consider, also, some general issues in models with\ncontinuous or discrete R symmetries, noting that it may be necessary to include\n$SU(2)$ triplet fields, and that these are subject to various constraints. In\nthe course of these discussions, we consider a number of naturalness problems.\nWe suggest that the so-called ``$\\mu$-problem\" is not a problem, and point out\nthat in models in which the axion decay constant is directly related to the\nSUSY breaking scale, squarks, sleptons and Higgs particles generically acquire\nhuge masses.\n",

Our approach automatically avoids problems\nassociated with infrared divergences in ordinary perturbation theory in\n$\\hbar$. The leading order result does not admit a first order phase\ntransition. The subleading result shows that the exact theory can admit at best\nonly a very weak first order phase transition. For $N=4$ and weak scalar\ncoupling we find that $T_1$, the temperature at which tunneling from the origin\nmay begin in the case of a first order transition, must be less than about 0.5\npercent larger than $T_2$, the temperature at which the origin changes from\nbeing a local minimum to being a local maximum.

In particular, if there is\nan additional gauged $U(1)$ symmetry at some large scale which can be made\nanomaly-free only by a Green-Schwarz (GS) mechanism, this typically results in\na prediction for the weak angle. In the case of the standard model one can see\nthat the standard Peccei-Quinn symmetry may be gauged and the anomalies\ncancelled through a GS mechanism. Remarkably enough, cancelation of anomalies\nworks only for the `canonical' value $sin^2\\theta _W=3/8$. In the case of the\nsupersymmetric standard model one can also find $U(1)$ currents which may be\nmade anomaly-free through a GS but the canonical value is only obtained in the\nabsence of any Higgs multiplet. If the analysis is extended to include $U(1)$\nR-symmetries, there is a unique class of $U(1)$s which give rise to the\ncanonical value. The R-symmetry is only anomaly-free for $sin^2\\theta\n_W=(4N_g-3)/(10N_g-3N_D-3)$, where $N_g,N_D$ are the number of generations and\nHiggs pairs. The natural context in which the above scenario may naturally\narise is string theory. I also emphasize other interesting possibilities\noffered by the GS mechanism to model-building.\n",

It is suggested that\ncertain ``distasteful allegations\" associated with quantum gravity such as loss\nof quantum coherence, unpredictability of fundamental parameters of particle\nphysics, and paradoxical features of black holes are likely to be circumvented\nby string theory. Finally there is a brief discussion of the importance of\nsupersymmetry at the TeV scale, both from a practical point of view and as a\npotentially significant prediction of string theory.\n",

Among\nthe challenging questions are the construction of the limit, and the\nexplanation of some of the emergent properties, in particular the behavior\nunder conformal maps as discussed in [LPS 94]. A descriptive account of the\nproject, and some related open problems, is found in ref. [A] and in [AB]\n(joint work with A.

The uniqueness question remains open; progress on it could shed\nlight on the purported universality of critical behavior and the apparent\nconformal invariance of the critical measures.

The physical consequences and relations to the\nprevious works are discussed. Furthermore, we derive equations for the\nsymmetric tensor of the second rank on the basis of the same modification of\nthe Bargmann-Wigner formalism, i.e., the equations which describe the dynamical\nbehavior of the field of the maximal spin 2.\n",

History quantum theories provide a conceptual and\nmathematical framework for formulating quantum theories without a globally\ndefined Hamiltonian time evolution and for introducing the concept of space\ntime event into quantum theory. On a mathematical level a history quantum\ntheory is characterized by the space of histories, which represent the space\ntime events, and by the space of decoherence functionals which represent the\nquantum mechanical states in the history approach. The second part of this\npaper is devoted to the study of the structure of the space of decoherence\nfunctionals for some physically reasonable spaces of histories in some detail.\nThe temporal reformulation of standard Hamiltonian quantum theories suggests to\nconsider the case that the space of histories is given by (i) the lattice of\nprojection operators on some Hilbert space or -- slightly more general -- (ii)\nthe set of projection operators in some von Neumann algebra. In the case (i)\nthe conditions are identified under which decoherence functionals can be\nrepresented by, respectively, trace class operators, bounded operators or\nfamilies of trace class operators on the tensor product of the underlying\nHilbert space by itself. Moreover we shall discuss the naturally arising\nrepresentations of decoherence functionals as sesquilinear forms.

I emphasize the rigorous\nnon-perturbative or constructive aspects of the theory. The usual formalism for\nthe renormalization group in field theory or statistical mechanics is reviewed,\ntogether with its limits. The constructive formalism is introduced step by\nstep. Taylor forest formulas allow to perform easily the cluster and Mayer\nexpansions which are needed for a single step of the renormalization group in\nthe case of Bosonic theories. The iteration of this single step leads to\nfurther difficulties whose solution is briefly sketched. The second part of the\ncourse is devoted to Fermionic models. These models are easier to treat on the\nconstructive level, so they are very well suited to beginners in constructive\ntheory. It is shown how the Taylor forest formulas allow to reorganize\nperturbation theory nicely in order to construct the Gross-Neveu2 model without\nany need for cluster or Mayer expansions.

A general construction scheme for kink states in\nthe framework of algebraic quantum field theory is developed in a previous\npaper.

In particular, we have measured dielectrons\n(e+e-) from p-p and p-d collisions to understand the basic dilepton production\nmechanisms in the energy range from 1.05 - 4.9 GeV. These data can be used to\ndetermine the basic processes which contribute to nucleon-nucleon dilepton\nproduction such as hadronic bremsstrahlung, vector meson processes, and\nhadronic Dalitz decay. The data show that a simple elastic bremsstrahlung\ncalculation is insufficient to explain the data. Theoretical models are\ncompared with the data. A new high statistics study of Ca-Ca at 1.05 A GeV has\nbeen made to study the collectivity of A-A collisions.\n",

The charge and mass\nidentification are based on a $\\Delta$E-E technique. A computer code determines\nthe conversion from ADC channels into energy values, atomic number and mass of\nthe detected fragments by comparing with energy loss calculations through a\nminimization routine. The procedure does not need prior measurements with beams\nof known energy and charge. An application of this technique to the calibration\nof the MULTICS apparatus is described.\n",

            "summary": "  Multi-fragment decays of 129Xe, 197Au, and 238U projectiles in collisions\nwith Be, C, Al, Cu, In, Au, and U targets at energies between E/A = 400 MeV and\n1000 MeV have been studied with the ALADIN forward-spectrometer at SIS. By\nadding an array of 84 Si-CsI(Tl) telescopes the solid-angle coverage of the\nsetup was extended to \\theta_lab = 16 degree. This permitted the complete\ndetection of fragments from the projectile-spectator source.\n  The dominant feature of the systematic set of data is the Z_bound\nuniversality that is obeyed by the fragment multiplicities and correlations.\nThese observables are invariant with respect to the entrance channel if plotted\nas a function of Z_bound, where Z_bound is the sum of the atomic numbers Z_i of\nall projectile fragments with Z_i \\geq 2. No significant dependence on the\nbombarding energy nor on the target mass is observed. The dependence of the\nfragment multiplicity on the projectile mass follows a linear scaling law.\n  The reasons for and the limits of the observed universality of spectator\nfragmentation are explored within the realm of the available data and with\nmodel studies. It is found that the universal properties should persist up to\nmuch higher bombarding energies than explored in this work and that they are\nconsistent with universal features exhibited by the intranuclear cascade and\nstatistical multifragmentation models.\n  PACS numbers: 25.70.Mn, 25.70.Pq, 25.75.-q\n",

Using the ability of the ORANGE setup to directly determine the\nopening angle of the e+e- pairs, the angular correlation of the emitted pairs\nwas measured.

The measurement was at an opening\nangle of theta_pq=11 degrees, covering a range in missing energy of E_m = 0 to\n65 MeV. The R_LT structure function is found to be consistent with zero for E_m\n> 50 MeV, confirming an earlier study which indicated that R_L vanishes in this\nregion. The integrated strengths of the p- and s-shell are compared with a\nDistorted Wave Impulse Approximation calculation. The s-shell strength and\nshape are compared with a Hartree Fock-Random Phase Approximation calculation.\nThe DWIA calculation overestimates the cross sections for p- and s-shell proton\nknockout as expected, but surprisingly agrees with the extracted R_LT value for\nboth shells.

If the iterative process goes astray, as it often\ndoes for a poor choice of starting scale parameters, the user has the\nopportunity to stop and start over with a better choice, guided by the result\nof the previous run. The ease of interaction with the equations also allows the\nuser to develop an intuition regarding their solutions and to explore the\nparameter space for the equations much more quickly.\n",

Likewise\n$M^{TuTts}_{\\mu}$ depends only on the elastic T-matrix evaluated at four sets\nof (u,t).

The precise expressions for\n$\\bar{M}^{TsTts}_{\\mu}$ and $\\bar{M}^{TuTts}_{\\mu}$ are determined by using the\nradiation decomposition identities of Brodsky and Brown. We point out that it\nis theoretically impossible to describe all bremsstrahlung processes by using\nonly a single class of soft-photon amplitudes.

A relativistic expression is obtained for the statistical\npotential. Axioms are again altered and made compatible with the general theory\nof relativity. These postulates, together with the idea of the statistical\npotential, allow us to obtain a general relativistic quantum theory for {\\it\nensembles} composed of single particle systems.\n",

In this paper we show how to use the language of\nstatistical field theory to address and solve problems in signal processing,\nthat is problems in which one must estimate some aspect of the environment from\nthe data in an array of sensors. In the field theory formulation the optimal\nestimator can be written as an expectation value in an ensemble where the input\ndata act as external field. Problems at low signal-to-noise ratio can be solved\nin perturbation theory, while high signal-to-noise ratios are treated with a\nsaddle-point approximation. These ideas are illustrated in detail by an example\nof visual motion estimation which is chosen to model a problem solved by the\nfly's brain. In this problem the optimal estimator has a rich structure,\nadapting to various parameters of the environment such as the mean-square\ncontrast and the correlation time of contrast fluctuations. This structure is\nin qualitative accord with existing measurements on motion sensitive neurons in\nthe fly's brain, and we argue that the adaptive properties of the optimal\nestimator may help resolve conlficts among different interpretations of these\ndata.

The slowness of this dynamics makes any conventional theory of\nchemical reactions inapplicable for description of enzymatic reactions. It is\npresumably a rule that it is the process of conformational relaxation, and not\nthe details of chemical mechanism, that affects their rate. In a simple model\nof Protein-Machine type, applied in constructing a novel theory of enzymatic\nreaction, conformational dynamics is treated as a realative quasi-continuous\nmotion of solid-like structural elements of protein.

We obtain a system of coupled equations describing the growth\nof planar membranes and vesicles, which is solved numerically for different\ninitial conditions.

The potential is obtained by optimization procedure, which\nsimultaneously maximizes the energy gap for {\\it all} proteins in the database.\nTo test our method and compare it with other knowledge-based approaches to\nderive potentials, we use simple lattice model. In the framework of the lattice\nmodel we build a database of model proteins by a) picking randomly 200 lattice\nchain conformations; b) designing sequences which fold into these structures\nwith some arbitrary ``true'' potential; c) use this database for extracting a\npotential; d) fold model proteins using the extracted potential. This test on\nthe model system showed that our procedure is able to recover the potential\nwith correlation $r \\approx 91\\%$ with the ``true'' one and we were able to\nfold all model structures using the recovered potential. Other statistical\nknowledge-based approaches were tested using lattice models and the results\nindicate that they also can recover the ``true'' potential with high degree of\naccuracy. When applied to real protein structures with energy function taken in\ncontact pairwise approximation, our potential scored somewhat better than\nexisting ones. However, the discrimination of the native structure from decoys\nis still not strong enough to make the potential useful for {\\em ab initio}\nfolding. We argue that more detail of protein structure and energetics should\nbe taken into account to achieve better energy gaps. The suggested method is\ngeneral to allow to systematically derive parameters for more sophisticated\nenergy function.

At fixed\ntemperature, each vesicle undergoes thermal shape fluctuations. We are able\nexperimentally to characterize the thermal shape ensemble by digitizing the\nvesicle outline in real time and storing the time-sequence of images. Analysis\nof this ensemble using the area-difference-elasticity (ADE) model of vesicle\nshapes allows us to associate (map) each time-sequence to a point in the\nzero-temperature (shape) phase diagram. Changing the laboratory temperature\nmodifies the control parameters (area, volume, etc.) of each vesicle, so it\nsweeps out a trajectory across the theoretical phase diagram. It is a\nnontrivial test of the ADE model to check that these trajectories remain\nconfined to regions of the phase diagram where the corresponding shapes are\nlocally stable. In particular, we study the thermal trajectories of three\nprolate vesicles which, upon heating, experienced a mechanical instability\nleading to budding. We verify that the position of the observed instability and\nthe geometry of the budded shape are in reasonable accord with the theoretical\npredictions. The inability of previous experiments to detect the ``hidden''\ncontrol parameters (relaxed area difference and spontaneous curvature) make\nthis the first direct quantitative confrontation between vesicle-shape theory\nand experiment.\n",

It is shown that tension is essential for describing\nthe dynamics in the presence of hernias. It is included in the model as long\nrange interactions over stretched DNA regions. The mobility of ring-shaped DNA\nis found to saturate much as in the well-studied case of linear DNA.\nExperiments in polymer gels, however, show that the mobility drops\nexponentially with the DNA ring size. This is commonly attributed to\ndangling-ends in the gel that can impale the ring. The predictions of the\npresent model are expected to apply to artificial 2D obstacle arrays (W.D.\nVolkmuth, R.H.

The hamiltonian presents both local (i.e. single helix, accounting\nfor the stiffness of the chain) and non local (interactions between\nhydrophobically-charged helices) terms, and is expected to provide a first tool\nfor studying the folding of real proteins. The partition function for a\nsimplified, but by no means trivial, version of the model is calculated almost\ncompletely in an analytical way. The latter simplified model is also applied to\nthe study of a synthetic protein, and some preliminary results are shown.\n",
